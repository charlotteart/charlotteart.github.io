         <h6>Historical context of OCD</h6>
         <p>As I was looking into my ancestry and thinking about the origins of my OCD, I became more interested in looking at how I / they would have been treated for the condition at the time. Studies have shown that OCD can be familial (genetic) (Pauls, 2010). Whilst researching my ancestors and making up stories of them having struggled with OCD too, I have been thinking of them and I as almost the same people. Therefore, treatment, seemed like an important aspect. Although I do this mostly out of person interest, I think that there is something to be said for the lack of collective knowledge about mental health in a historical context – other than the crazy witches. Although the witches burned at the stake, were taught about in school it was always described to me without the mention of mental health. However, The Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer), includes one of the first known descrip8ons of OCD, and was a guidebook for identifying and prosecuting witches (Storch, Gehen and Murphy, 2007, p.2). Naturally, this wouldn’t justify the practice of drowning and burning women, but to me there is a comfort in understanding that people (particularly women) have always been excluded and made to feel mad. This leads me to question ‘Why does it make me feel better to make up stories about people going through the same horrible thing that I have experienced?’ To that, I have no answer other than to look to the human desire to find one’s community, despite it sounding strange even to me, to have a fake community of pain. The humours and bloodletting, again fictional, seem to me a nice answer, if only it were so simple. Despite my mother’s repulsion towards this concept, it seems to me that it would be much simpler than hours of therapy, although need not worry I know that it wouldn’t work! I am grounded in real life most ways.</p>

         <h6>Marina Abramović at The Royal Academy</h6>
         <p>Last Autumn, the Royal Academy showcased Marina Abramovic’s last 50 years of work, making her the first woman to host a solo show in their Main Galleries (Royal Academy of Arts, n.d.), owing to her status as ‘an art world icon and a performance art pioneer’ (Royal Academy of Arts, 2023a). The exhibition was heavily advertised across London and received great acclaim. It included live reperformances of her past works as well as photos and videos documenting the original performances. Although the exhibition consisted of 13 rooms, this essay will mainly explore her work including self-injury which I found particularly interesting and difficult to appreciate.
            The visitor begins the journey into harm early on when we are introduced to Rhythm 0, 1974. In the original performance, Abramović offered herself alongside an array of objects which the audience could use on her however they liked. A series of images taken on this day were displayed, next to a table on which the same objects had been placed. The relationship between the viewer and her body
            was meant to reflect the audience’s own state of mind (Archey et al., 2023, pp.77, 93). However, seeing a male dominated audience, highlighted the liberty with which they abuse women and see them for their bodies only, and how women
           have been taught to passively accept this and even take
            responsibility for it, as she does here. Despite Abramović’s insistence of not identifying as a feminist (“I am the most non- feminist human!”) (Messinger, 2015), it is hard not to read the performance as such. Ethically I began to question the act of opening herself up to abuse and at which point it becomes a romanticisation of daily lived domestic abuse.
            The work she produced with Ulay (her then partner and artist himself), is at times beautiful both visually and in terms of their connection. However, they often follow gender stereotypes,
             Rhythm 0 exhibition display (Parry and Royal Academy of Arts, 2023)
              Rest Energy in the exhibition
            (Abramović and Ulay, 1980)
            making the work less modern and instead sensational. For example, in the work Rest Energy, 1980, Abramović and Ulay hold a bow and arrow in equilibrium. Ulay pulls the string taught and Abramović holds the other side, threatened by the arrow pointed at her heart. Abramović has stated that the work was about ‘complete and total trust’ (MoMA, 2010) however, it can also be read as power dynamics in heterosexual relationships (Snow, 2022, pp.43–51).
              Lips of Thomas (Abramović, 1994)
           Originally a live performance, Lips of Thomas (Star on Stomach), 1975, was presented as a single photo (Archey et al., 2023, pp.77, 93). The star represents the communist regime she grew up under and carving it on her skin shows its duality as an identifier for her as much as a traumatic emblem. She has stated that in the 70s, it was
            important for her to create pieces that were ‘disturbing and dangerous’ (Stiles et al., 2008, pp.11–22). Seeing the work retrospectively, with very little explanation from the RA, who simply described the work as an exploration of the impact on communism on herself and others, felt far removed from anything that she had tried to communicate to the audience. Whilst Abramović herself draws a line of distinction between staged pain and pain that someone is unwillingly subjected to, for example illness or torture, the RA made no comment on this. She likens it to Catholic and Orthodox rituals and credits it as a way to understand the mind and body (Stiles et al., 2008, pp.11–22).
            This feeling of discomfort continued with Rhythm 10, 1973. Inspired by a Slavic drinking game, she arranged 20 knives in front of her and then stabbed knives in between her fingers until she hit her hand. She then switched knives until having used them all, whilst recording this on audio. Then she repeated the same thing whilst listening to the audio to synchronise past and present. Lastly, she listened to the audio of both simultaneously; to her the most important thing was to express time as sound (Stiles et al., 2008, pp.11–22). There was no mention of this in the exhibition.
              Rhythm 10 (Abramović, 1973)
          
            Can Abramović’s work be defined by her gender and read as a way to break out of femininity and beauty? Snow (2022, pp.43–51) argues that Marina Abramović’s work cannot be separated from her role as a woman. She argues that for a woman, the act of committing self- injury is entangled with her relationship with men. In an artistic environment, whilst men commit these acts on themselves as a proof of strength, women do so to show independence from gender roles. This is reminiscent of Berger’s (1972) Ways of Seeing theory that a woman views herself through the eyes of a man, with no escape.
            I believe that part of the fervour for Marina Abramović comes from the way that she markets herself. Now 77, she calls herself the ‘grandmother of performance art’ (Weidemann, Larass and Klier, 2008, pp.128–129). She has founded an institute and sells her method (a week long workshop with MAI trained artists costs over £2,000 (Marina Abramović Institute, n.d.)). There is something slightly jarring about the commercialisation of her practice, although perhaps it is time to reconciliate being an artist and making money from it.
            All this struck me as confusing. After the exhibition I felt little desire to follow her method. ‘Reaching a higher consciousness and confronting life’s challenges’ (Royal Academy of Arts, 2023c) seemed a romanticisation of self-harm and self-imposed hardships. In an age of mental health awareness, it is surprising that the Royal Academy did not consider this issue. Before going to the exhibition there is little warning about what one is to face. To include the work is paramount when curating a retrospective of her work and to leave it out would be inauthentic. However, the detachment with which these pieces were shown, and the emphasis on mental clarity and true presence (Royal Academy of Arts, 2023b) instead of mental torment was awkward. This also promotes the tortured artist trope and the idea that pain is a requirement for creativity, Abramović herself thinks that no good visual art comes from happiness (Marchese, 2023). Although Abramović creates all her pieces of her own volition, it has the potential of creating a dangerous precedent and a sense of competition of who can take body art the farthest (S., n.d.).</p>
